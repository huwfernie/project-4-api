# README

This is the backend for the project-4-frontend in my GitHub account. See that readme for more details on the project.

## Backend:

The whole backend is built with Ruby on rails serving JSON data. all gems are in the gemfile so if you want to clone the repo and run `$ gem install` followed by `$ Rails s` you should be able to access the data on `http://localhost:3000`.

The database uses PostgreSQL, so that will need to be running first.
